# GM4 Resources (but Faithful 32x32)
a 32x32 version of the GM4 Resources, like [the old one](https://github.com/adriaan1313/GM4_Resources_32x32), but properly proper this time, I hope.


anyways: These are my own work using textures from the GM4 Resources (these and its texture credits can be found [here](https://github.com/Gamemode4Dev/GM4_Resources)) and combining them with textures from [Faithful 32x](https://faithfulpack.net/faithful32x/latest). There should be a credits.md here in a bit - I will add the credits as I migrate them from the old repo or create them.
