# GM4 Resources (but Faithful 32x32)
a 32x32 version of the GM4 Resources, like [the old one](https://github.com/adriaan1313/GM4_Resources_32x32), but properly proper this time, I hope.


anyways: These are my own work using textures from the GM4 Resources (these and its texture credits can be found [here](https://github.com/Gamemode4Dev/GM4_Resources)) and combining them with textures from [Faithful 32x](https://faithfulpack.net/faithful32x/latest). There should be a credits.md here in a bit - I will add the credits as I migrate them from the old repo or create them.

The old one was mostly based on [a version of Faithful 32x](https://archive.org/download/le_pack_2.0__extras/le%2Bpack%2B2.0%2B%2B%2Bextras.zip) sent to my by [Hozz](https://github.com/hozz8528). It was a Faithful.team version of Faithful, so I'd like to move away from it, even though I quite prefer the Le Pack 2.0 textures.

Since the Faithful.team version seems like it doesn't do credits, I credit them as \"$${\color{EvilFaithful}Red}$$\" in the credits file, these images should be replaced with proper Faithful-based ones.
